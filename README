Unrpyc is a script to decompile Ren'Py (http://www.renpy.org/) compiled .rpyc
script files. It will not extract files from .rpa archives. For that, use UnRPA
(https://github.com/Lattyware/unrpa).

Unrpyc needs some internal Ren'Py structures to work. You will need the renpy
module in your Python module search path, or copy it to the unrpyc directory.

Usage options:

Options:
  --version      show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -c, --clobber  overwrites existing output files
Usage: unrpyc.py [options] script1 script2 ...

You can give several .rpyc files on the command line. Each script will be
decompiled to a corresponding .rpy on the same directory. By default, the
program will not overwrite existing files, use -c to do that.

This script is incomplete and won't disassemble all AST nodes. A warning will be
printed and a placeholder inserted in the script when it finds a node it doesn't
know how to handle.
